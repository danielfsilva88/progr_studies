#You will need to design a class called "LongitudinalData" that
# characterizes the structure of this longitudinal dataset. You will
# also need to design classes to represent the concept of a subject, a visit, and a room.

#In addition you will need to implement the following functions

#make_LD: a function that converts a data frame into a LongitudinalData object
make_LD <- function(){

}



#subject: a generic function for extracting subject-specific information
subject <- function(){

}



#visit: a generic function for extracting visit-specific information
visit <- function(){

}



#room: a generic function for extracting room-specific information
room <- function(){
    
}
